# Hangman_game
Its a game made in python.
Hangman was one, other than some chit games, to guess words according to the guesses determined and as soon as they lost all their wrong guesses, they were hanged (not really, but on paper).

The objective of our project is to implement the hangman game using Python. It doesnâ€™t require any specific modules other than random and time. Python loops and functions are enough to build this game here.
